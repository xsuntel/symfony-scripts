## 1. Why a cold subagent needs everything spelled out

**Every subagent starts cold.** It inherits none of the orchestrator's context — not the changed-file
list, not the intent, not the rule it should read. Re-deriving that scope is the single largest way a
spawn wastes its budget, and a subagent that guesses wrong produces a confident, wrong report.

This is why the **Spawn Prompt Contract** has six mandatory items rather than "describe the task". The
items are not stylistic; each closes a specific observed failure:

| Item | Failure it prevents |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Target files, enumerated | "the changed files" → the agent runs `git diff` itself and picks a different set |
| 2. Exactly one role | a reviewer that starts fixing, or an author that starts judging its own work |
| 3. SoT rule paths, preflighted | an agent told to read a missing rule has **no criteria at all** and improvises |
| 4. Output destination | a write-blocked agent assigned a tmp path fails at its final step (§3) |
| 5. Scope limits | recursive spawning, and edits outside the intended blast radius |
| 6. Prior artifact inline | a worktree-isolated reviewer reporting a clean pass on work it never read (§2) |

---

## 2. Worktree isolation — the highest-consequence constraint

`[Verified]` 2026-09-11 [WebFetch: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/subagents>]. A worktree created by
`isolation: worktree` branches **by default from the repository's default branch rather than the parent
session's `HEAD`**. A fresh worktree therefore has:

- **none of the author's uncommitted edits to tracked files** — they live in the parent working tree,
  and the worktree is cut from the default branch, not from it;
- **no usable `.claude/tmp/` handoff** — either the tree is absent, or it is a private copy seeded at
  spawn that never receives the parent's later writes and never propagates its own back.

> ⚠️ **The tmp half is deliberately stated as a disjunction — do not collapse it.** Whether a worktree
> carries untracked and gitignored files has now read three ways across three sweeps of the subagents
> page: "tracked content only" (2026-08-30), "includes untracked and gitignored files from base branch"
> (2026-09-09), "includes tracked files only (no untracked or gitignored files)" (2026-09-11). **Both
> consequences above hold under every one of those readings**, because the load-bearing fact is the
> **base branch** — that is what makes an isolated reviewer's `git diff` come back empty. Resist the urge
> to "tidy" the disjunction into whichever branch the docs assert this week.

Author and reviewer are two separate `Agent` calls, so each gets its own worktree checked out from the
default branch.

> This paragraph read "checked out from HEAD" until 2026-08-29. The corrected base makes the isolation
> **stronger**, not weaker — a worktree branched from the default branch can be further behind the
> parent session than one branched from `HEAD` — so every consequence below stands unchanged.

> **Added 2026-08-30 — isolation can be imposed from above.** `[Verified]`
> [WebFetch: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/subagents>]: "When the main conversation runs isolated in
> a worktree, the same checks apply to every subagent, **including those without
> `isolation: worktree`**." So the "not isolated" list in §2 below describes the **normal case**, not a
> guarantee: when the main session is itself worktree-isolated, even a reviewer with no `isolation` key
> is subject to the same working-directory checks. Practical consequence for an orchestrator: the
> **returned report is the channel that always works**, and a `.claude/tmp/` handoff is an optimisation
> that holds only while the session is not isolated. Never make a tmp path the sole channel.

> **The failure mode:** a reviewer told to "run `git diff` and review the result" sees an **empty diff**,
> finds nothing wrong with nothing, and returns **PASS on work it never read**. Nothing errors. The
> orchestrator relays a clean verdict, and the `[MUST]` that was actually there reaches the user as a
> merge-ready change. This is the most damaging silent failure available in this repository.

**The imperative both orchestrators carry:** paste the author's **full unified diff text inline** into
the reviewer's prompt. Never route a reviewer to a path and assume it can reach the bytes.

Two corollaries worth stating, because both have been "fixed" in the wrong direction before:

- **Do not revert an author to "the reviewer reads the same diff."** `skills/utility-claude-code-skill/references/artifact-spec-guide.md`
  marks that regression as a `[MUST]`.
- **Vendor-dependent gates are unrunnable today — but do not blame the worktree.** `php-cs-fixer`,
  `phpstan`, `phpunit` and `bin/console` all need `app/vendor`, which is **gitignored**
  (`.gitignore:40`) and therefore **carried into a worktree** under the corrected behaviour above. The
  real blocker is that `app/` holds only `.gitkeep`. `[Verified]` 2026-09-09 — this bullet previously
  said such gates "cannot run in a worktree unless the agent installs dependencies there".

### 2-1. This fact is duplicated across ~41 files — do not "fix" that with `@see`

`[Measured]` 2026-09-09. The obvious refactor is to state the isolation mechanism **once, here**, and
have every other file reference it. **That refactor is wrong for most of the sites, and this section
exists to stop it being attempted.**

**22 of the 41 are agent prompts.** An agent starts cold: it inherits nothing, and `@see` is a
**notation, not an import** — the text only arrives if the agent spends a `Read` on it. Replacing an
inline imperative with a pointer therefore converts a guarantee into a hope, which is exactly the
failure this document's opening section describes. The split is the one already stated at the top of
this file:

| Site kind | Count | Carries | May it be replaced by `@see`? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agents/**` | 22 | the **imperative** (inline the diff; do not use tmp as the only channel) | **No** — cold start |
| `rules/*-agent-team-rule.md` | 3 | the **verdict** (violating it is a `[MUST]`) | **No** — the rule is the SoT |
| `agent-memory/**` | 2 | the always-loaded reminder | **No** — that is its whole purpose |
| `docs/`, `skills/**` guides | 14 | **rationale and consequences** | **Yes** — these are read on demand |

### 2-2. The real defect was findability, not duplication

**The 2026-09-09 correction had to be applied twice, because a `grep` missed 13 files the first time.**
The fact was phrased about eight different ways and **wrapped at different columns**, so a literal
search for the retired three-word phrase did not match the files that happened to break the line
between its second and third word — nor the ones that broke it between the first and second.
Duplication was survivable; **inconsistent wording plus line wrapping was not.**

> The retired phrases themselves are deliberately kept **only inside the `CLAIMS` list below**, never in
> this prose. Quoting one here would make this document match its own audit forever.

**So the audit must normalise whitespace before matching.** A plain `grep` is not sufficient for this
class of claim and must not be relied on:

```bash
# Find every site carrying the isolation fact, regardless of wording or line wrapping.
python3 - <<'EOF'
import pathlib, re
CLAIMS = ["tracked content only", "absent from your worktree", "absent from every worktree",
          "no .claude/tmp/ at all", "installing dependencies there does not help"]
for p in sorted(pathlib.Path(".claude").rglob("*.md")):
    body = re.sub(r"```.*?```", " ", p.read_text(), flags=re.S)   # drop fences: this script quotes CLAIMS
    flat = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", body)
    for c in CLAIMS:
        for m in re.finditer(re.escape(c), flat):
            ctx = flat[max(0, m.start()-260):m.end()+60]
            if any(k in ctx for k in ("Corrected", "corrected", "previously", "passage said")):
                continue          # a dated correction note quoting the old text is expected
            print(f"STALE {p}: …{ctx[-160:]}")
EOF
```

**The retired claims above are the search keys.** When this contract changes again, add the newly
retired wording to `CLAIMS` rather than inventing a fresh grep — that list is what makes the sweep
complete, and it is the reason the second pass found the 13 stragglers.

### Which agents are isolated

The authoritative count lives in `skills/utility-claude-code-skill/references/artifact-spec-guide.md` (`Agent isolation / maxTurns`)
and is deliberately **not restated here** — that command is the verdict SoT, and a second copy is
exactly the drift this file exists to prevent. The shape of the split, which is stable:

- **Isolated (`isolation: worktree`)** — the domain agents scoped to `app/**` sources: the `app-*`
  roster, plus `api-platform-author`, `-analyzer`, `-debugger`, `-tester`.
- **Not isolated** — the four orchestrators, the eight `utility-*` agents, `api-platform-reviewer`, and
  the six infrastructure reviewers.

The convention follows the **agent's domain scope, not whether it writes** — a read-only analyzer
scoped to `app/**` is still isolated. Do not flag that as inconsistent.

## 3. Who may write where

**Three** independent restrictions stack, and confusing them produces spawns that fail at their last
step:

| Restriction | Mechanism | Consequence for the orchestrator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cannot write any file** | `disallowedTools: Edit, Write` on the analyzers and reviewers | Ask for findings **in the returned report**. Assigning a tmp path guarantees failure |
| **Can write, but nobody can read it** | `isolation: worktree` + `.claude/tmp/` gitignored | The returned report is the only channel. A tmp path writes into a private directory |
| **Allowed to write, but refused at call time** | inherited `permissionMode` — `settings.json` sets `permissions.defaultMode: "plan"`, which is read-only | Applies to **the orchestrators themselves**: they hold `Write` but declare no `permissionMode`, so their own tmp report is denied while the session is in plan mode |

> **The third row was added on 2026-08-30 and is the one that bites the orchestrators.** `[Verified]`
> [Read: .claude/settings.json] + [WebFetch: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/subagents>]: "If you
> leave it unset, the subagent inherits the main conversation's mode." The 16 write-path agents
> (`*-author`, `*-tester`, `*-debugger`) declare `permissionMode: acceptEdits` precisely to escape
> this; the four orchestrators deliberately do not, because they orchestrate rather than edit. The
> consequence is that **an orchestrator's consolidated tmp report is best-effort, not guaranteed** —
> the returned report is the required channel. Nothing in this repository reads those tmp reports, so
> nothing breaks when the write is refused; what would break is an orchestrator that reports a path it
> never managed to write, or that burns turns retrying, or that reaches for `Bash` redirection to
> defeat the permission mode.
>
> **Granting the orchestrators `permissionMode: acceptEdits` is the alternative, and it is a
> deliberate escalation** — they also hold unrestricted `Bash`, and their `Write` path scoping is
> prose-only, so auto-accepting their writes widens real blast radius. It needs an explicit decision,
> not a silent fix.

`memory: project` auto-grants `Write` and `Edit`, but **`disallowedTools` reverses that per tool** — so
the read-only agents' discipline is enforced by the harness, not by prose. They retain `Bash`, so the
read-only boundary is still partly self-held.

**Only give a tmp path to an agent that is both write-capable and non-isolated.** In practice that is a
short list, and `api-platform-reviewer` is the notable case of an agent that can *read* a tmp artifact
while being unable to write one.

### tmp mechanics

- **`mkdir -p` the full parent chain**, not just `.claude/tmp`. A nested path such as
  `.claude/tmp/api/providers/finance/` fails to write if only the first tier exists.
- **Cleanup is not available.** `settings.json` denies `Bash(rm:*)` outright and a deny rule outranks
  any allow; retention is handled by `cleanupPeriodDays` and `.gitignore`.
- `.claude/tmp` is gitignored at `.gitignore:4`. `[Verified]`

---

## 4. Partial results are still results

A spawned agent can fail outright, return nothing usable, or exhaust its own `maxTurns`. **Never discard
a whole orchestration because one branch failed** — but never paper over the gap either.

The distinction that matters most:

> **"Clean" and "did not run" are different verdicts.** An analyzer that never executed is not a clean
> security result. Reporting it as one is the second-most damaging failure mode here, after §2.

Consequences the orchestrators encode:

- A failed branch **does not block** the other branches' findings from being reported.
- But go/no-go **must state that coverage was incomplete**, because a `[MUST]` may be hiding in the
  branch that did not run.
- **Never fabricate or pre-empt the result of a spawn that has not returned.**
- On `maxTurns` exhaustion, take the partial output, mark the branch **incomplete**, and recommend a
  narrower re-run — do not auto-retry.

### Gates that pass by not running

The four `PostToolUse` hooks (`php-lint.sh`, `php-cs-fixer.sh`, `twig-lint.sh`, `js-guard.sh`) are
non-blocking by design and **skip silently** when their precondition is missing, via
`[ -d app/vendor ] || exit 0`. `[Verified]` [Read: .claude/hooks/post-tool-use/app-twig-lint.sh:39]

**`exit 0` therefore does not mean "passed".** With `app/vendor` currently absent, the PHP and Twig
gates are largely inert and only `php -l` and `js-guard.sh` genuinely run. Any gate that did not run
must be relayed as **"unchecked"** — never as a pass.

---

## 5. The retry budget belongs to the orchestrator

Every `*-author` agent states in its own body that it **does not count retries**
(`app-php-symfony-author.md:136`, `api-platform-author.md:153`). If the orchestrator does not track them
either, a REDO cycle runs unbounded.

- **Count invocations of the entry point**, not `[MUST]` findings.
- **Limit 3 for code domains**, 2 for config and meta domains (commit, diagram, Claude Code config).
- **Past the limit, do not revert the source.** Stop as-is, list the unresolved instructions, and
  recommend manual review. Reverting discards work the user may want to finish by hand.
- On REDO, re-invoke the **same entry point** with **only the `[MUST]` items** — not the full review.

---

## 6. Relaying

**A subagent's final report is not shown to the user.** Only the orchestrator sees it.

- Anything the user needs must be **restated** in the consolidated report.
- Never write "see the reviewer's output" — there is no output for the user to see.
- Merge duplicates on the same file and line into one entry at the **strictest** severity.
- Sort by `[MUST]` > `[SHOULD]` > `[CONSIDER]`; **only `[MUST]` blocks a merge**.

---

## 7. Bounding the fan-out

`maxTurns: 50` is the whole budget for one orchestration, and each spawn plus each returned result
consumes turns.

- Cap parallel spawns at **6 per batch**.
- With more targets, batch by priority (code domains before infrastructure) and report the remainder as
  **deferred** — never drop them silently.
- Never spawn the same agent twice for the same file in one invocation.
- Spawn independent branches **in parallel**; only ordered loops (author→reviewer) run sequentially.
- As the budget nears exhaustion, stop spawning, consolidate what returned, and report the untouched
  targets explicitly.

---

## 8. Preflight

Routing tables drift ahead of the tree, so **treat every routing target as unverified until checked** —
agent file, skill `SKILL.md`, command file, and any rule cited as SoT in a spawn prompt.

**When a target is missing, do not substitute a near-match and do not silently skip it.** Report it as
an unroutable target, naming the path that was expected, and continue with the targets that resolved.
A missing artifact is a repository defect worth surfacing, not an obstacle to route around.

**The provider domain used to be this section's worked example, and it is now the cautionary one.**
`[Verified]` 2026-08-24 this document recorded that a provider-path change was **unroutable** because
none of `.claude/rules/api/`, `.claude/commands/api/providers/` or the five `api-providers-*-build-skill`
directories existed. `[Verified]` 2026-09-09: **the route is live** — six skills
(`app-src-service-api-{rest,oauth2,websocket}-{build,client}-skill`) implement the domain under a
transport-agnostic naming scheme the old check never searched for.

**The lesson generalises, which is why the correction stays here.** *"The artifact is missing"* is a
claim about **a name**, and a name is exactly what drifts between design and implementation. Before
reporting a target as unroutable, search the tree by **capability** (what would serve this path?) and
not only by the name the routing table happens to record. Redirecting a provider path to
`app-php-symfony-reviewer`, which holds no transport criteria, remains wrong.

---

## 9. Why each roster is self-held

Every orchestrator states that it may spawn only its own prefix family. **Nothing in the harness
enforces that**, and knowing why is what keeps the constraint from being quietly rationalised away the
first time a cross-roster spawn looks cheaper than a referral.

`[Verified]` 2026-08-30 [WebFetch: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/subagents>]:

> "The `Agent(agent_type)` allowlist syntax applies only to an agent running as the main thread with
> `claude --agent`. In a subagent definition, listing `Agent` in `tools` lets that subagent spawn
> subagents of its own while the depth limit allows it, but **any type list inside the parentheses is
> ignored**."

So `tools: Agent(app-php-symfony-reviewer, …)` in an orchestrator definition buys nothing. Only two
harness-level alternatives exist, and both are worse than model compliance:

| Alternative | Why it is rejected |
| --- | --- |
| Omit `Agent` from `tools` entirely | The documented way to stop an agent nesting at all — which removes the orchestrator's entire reason to exist |
| A `disallowedTools` denylist of every non-roster agent | Wrong shape: it must enumerate the **complement** of the roster, so it grows and goes stale every time any agent is added anywhere in the tree |

The denylist's defect is the decisive one. A roster is an **allowlist by nature**, and expressing it as
a denylist inverts the maintenance burden onto the part of the tree the orchestrator does not own. The
authoritative agent census lives in `skills/utility-claude-code-skill/references/artifact-spec-guide.md`; **the counts are
deliberately not restated here or in the agent prompts**, because a complement count is exactly the
kind of measured number that drifts silently.

**The consequence each agent prompt carries as an imperative:** roster discipline is self-held, and the
per-invocation checklist is its only backstop. That is why every orchestrator's checklist ends with an
explicit "was every spawn inside the permitted set?" line — it is not ceremony, it is the enforcement.
