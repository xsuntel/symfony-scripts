# Registered in: .claude/settings.json → hooks.PostToolUse (matcher "Edit|Write").
# Contract: Claude Code pipes the hook payload as JSON on stdin; format the just-edited file when it falls
#           inside the fixer's own finder scope, using the project php-cs-fixer.
# Runs after php-lint.sh, which reports syntax errors — the fixer is a silent no-op on a file that does not
# parse, so the lint has to speak first.
# Strict mode is ON, but every step that can realistically fail is explicitly tolerated so the script
# always reaches `exit 0` — PostToolUse must stay non-blocking so a formatter hiccup never disturbs the
# Edit/Write result (exit 2 would surface an error to Claude, and any other non-zero exit shows a
# non-blocking error notice on the very next tool call).
