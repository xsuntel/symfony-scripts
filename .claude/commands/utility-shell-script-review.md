description: "Holds the authoring conventions and quality judgment criteria for shell scripts — provides two modes: review of an existing `.sh` file (MUST/SHOULD/CONSIDER) and self-verification of a new draft (PASS/REDO)."
argument-hint: "[path to the shell script file to analyze]"
---

Analyze the following shell script file:

**`$ARGUMENTS`**

> **When the argument is empty**, review the contents of @.claude/hooks/**/*.sh and @scripts/**/*.sh and
> fix/supplement them against the official docs.
> Do not blindly scan all of `scripts/**` or guess a target.
> **Scope caution:** `.claude/hooks/**` holds standalone hook scripts, so apply only the **universal
> safety · portability · style criteria** (shebang, variable quoting, `rm -rf` guard, `set -e` judgment,
> ShellCheck). Do not apply the `scripts/**`-specific module-architecture clauses (bootstrap,
> `_abstract.sh` sourcing, lifecycle, taxonomy).

The single source of truth (SoT) for the judgment criteria is **`utility-shell-script-style.md` for
shell style, and `utility-shell-script-rule.md` for operations/architecture** (bootstrap, global
variables, sourcing, idempotency, taxonomy). Read the references below at the start, cross-check each clause against the
target code, flag violations with the **exact line number**, and provide concrete fixes (improved code
snippets).

> **Caution:** this project deliberately differs from general Bash best practice — `set -euo pipefail`
> being **commented out** is correct (control flows through `setExit`/`setEnd`), the shebang is
> `#!/bin/bash` (only a container entrypoint uses `#!/bin/sh`), and unrecoverable errors use `setExit`
> (SIGKILL). Do not flag these as "violations" on general grounds — judge only against the SoT documents.

## Judgment Modes

This command **holds both the authoring conventions and the judgment criteria**. The mode is determined
by what the target is.

| Mode | Target | Procedure | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Existing file review** (default) | the real `.sh` file given as `$ARGUMENTS` | `## Review Procedure` | `[MUST]` / `[SHOULD]` / `[CONSIDER]` |
| **B. Draft self-verification** | `./.claude/tmp/utility/shell-script/script-draft.md` | `## Authoring Conventions` → `## Review Procedure` | `PASS` / `REDO` + correction instructions |

Mode B is the loop the `utility-shell-script-skill` skill runs when authoring a new script — in the same
session it produces a draft per `## Authoring Conventions`, self-verifies it via `## Review Procedure`,
then writes it to the target path on `PASS`, or on `REDO` rewrites applying only the correction
instructions (**at most 2 retries**; beyond that, stop and recommend manual review).

> Before 2026-08-16 a `utility-shell-script-author` / `utility-shell-script-reviewer` agent pair owned
> this loop. Since the judgment criteria converge on this single file, it was converted to
> command-based self-verification — the same shape as the Claude Code config (2026-08-08) and provider
> (2026-08-15) domains.

## Authoring Conventions (Mode B — drafting)

Before writing, read the shell style SoT and **1–2 existing scripts of the same kind**, and follow their
bootstrap, naming, and structure exactly. The list below is a summary of the SoT; the output style is
the source for the details and templates.

- **Shebang:** entry-point scripts use `#!/bin/bash`, a container entrypoint uses `#!/bin/sh`. `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is forbidden.
- **Strict mode:** `set -euo pipefail` is **commented out** (`#set -euo pipefail`) — the intended design of the source-based module architecture.
- **Bootstrap:** a directly executed entry point follows the order `find_project_root` → `cd "${PROJECT_PATH}"` → source `_abstract.sh`. Sourced helpers (`_*.sh`) do not repeat the bootstrap.
- **Source guard:** place an `if [ -f ... ]` existence check before every `source` (no bare source).
- **Naming:** lifecycle-phase functions are `camelCase` (`setStart` · `setPhp` · `setEnd`), reusable helpers are `snake_case` (`find_project_root` · `log_error`). Always expand variables as `"${VAR}"`.
- **Destructive commands:** `rm -rf` uses the `rm -rf "${VAR:?}/path"` guard. Inside a sourced file, use `setExit` (SIGKILL) / `setEnd` (normal termination) instead of `exit 1`.
- **Menus · platforms:** interactive selection uses `select` + `PS3` + `$REPLY`. Platform branching covers Linux/Darwin/Windows plus an `else` → `setExit`.
- **Idempotent install:** install packages behind a `dpkg -l` (or `brew list` on macOS) check guard.

**Authoring principles**

- **Comment language: English** (comment only the why/constraint, omit the what) — the project shell style convention.
- Mirror the bootstrap, section banner (111 chars), and function order of an existing script of the same kind — do not invent new conventions.
- Use only the global variable names defined in `_abstract.sh`, and do not invent non-existent globals, helpers, or paths.
- Unless explicitly requested, leave no placeholders like `# TODO` — write a **complete, runnable script** starting from the shebang.
- Record the draft at `./.claude/tmp/utility/shell-script/script-draft.md` (when writing via Bash, run `mkdir -p .claude/tmp/utility/shell-script` first).

## Review Procedure

Cross-check each SoT item: shebang · strict mode (confirm it is commented out) · variable quoting
(`"${VAR}"`) · `local` · function naming (lifecycle = `camelCase`, helper = `snake_case`) · source guard
(source only after an existence check) · path handling (`find_project_root` · `PROJECT_PATH`) · platform
branching (Linux/Darwin/Windows + `else setExit`) · logging format (`[ LABEL ]` · separators) · security
(input validation, command injection, the `rm -rf "${VAR:?}"` guard) · duplication (shared logic belongs
in `_abstract.sh`).

Additionally, confirm the following:

- **No repeated bootstrap** — does a sourced helper (`_*.sh`) avoid repeating the `find_project_root` · `_abstract.sh` sourcing block?
- **Exit handling** — inside a sourced file, does it use `setExit` (unrecoverable) / `setEnd` (normal termination) rather than a bare `exit`?
- **Idempotent install** — does package installation have a `dpkg -l` (or `brew list` on macOS) check guard?
- **ShellCheck gate** — respecting the disabled rules in `scripts/.shellcheckrc`, are there no other warnings left (mandatory before merge)?
- **Reference factuality** — do the findings and fixes reference only real global variables, functions, and paths (the `_abstract.sh` catalog)?

### Critical Issues (must fix)

For each issue: **[Line N]** `[MUST]` description → recommended fix including a code snippet.

### Improvement Suggestions (recommended)

For each suggestion: **[Line N]** `[SHOULD]` description → recommended approach.

### Refactoring Suggestions

Mark structural changes (function extraction, consolidating shared utilities, etc.) as `[CONSIDER]` and
describe them with before/after code examples. Only `[MUST]` blocks a merge.

## Output Format — Mode B (draft self-verification)

Record the result at `./.claude/tmp/utility/shell-script/script-review.md` in the format below.

- **Verdict:** PASS | REDO
- **Reason:** 2–3 lines of specific rationale
- **Correction instructions:** only on REDO — specific enough to apply directly in the rewrite

**Verdict principles**

- Use **only the objective criteria** in `## Review Procedure`, not subjective writing quality.
- Issue a REDO only when a rewrite is actually needed — convention deviation, a safety defect (missing guard, destructive command), or a non-existent reference.
- When the verdict is uncertain, choose REDO over PASS — a miss costs more than a false alarm.
- When applying a REDO, **do not arbitrarily change anything outside the correction instructions.**
